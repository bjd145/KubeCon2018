# Introduction to Distributive Tracing 
* Lita 
* Metrics
  * Fire them in your applications 
  * Error rates, throughput, staturations, CPU usage, memory usage 
  * Health of your system 
* Logging 
  * Generated by application 
  * display error and stack traces 
  * debugging your application 
* Distributive Tracing does not replace metrics or logging 
* With Monoliths metrics and logging was fine.  Single request tool one process on one processs
* Microservices - 
  * hard to reason why a request failed 
  * more logs to stitch together
  * manual review of requests by request id or ride id
    * easy to do when you have a couple services 
* What happens when you have 100s or 1000s of services 
* This is what Distributive Tracing tries to solve
  
## Visualization 
* Span - start and end time. how long a request took 
  * stacks microservics calls on top of each other 
* time context visualization 
* Feels like New Relic or Application Insights

## Instrumentation (at lyft) 
* Challenges Microservices Architecture (Go, Python, java, php)
* don't want product engineers to think about visualization 
  * ship features not instrumentation code
  * traces gets more useful as more services instrumente 
  * Monkey patching doesn't scale 
* No Vendor lock-in 

## OpenTracing 
* CNCF project
* Interface and open standard data model for instrumentation 
* Has libraries for mnay languages 
* Vendor neutral 
* https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-csharp
* Jaeger is an implementation of OpenTracing 
  * https://www.jaegertracing.io/
  * jaeger agent runs on nodes or as side car.  
  * agent send to jaeger server and stored in a cassandra data
  * enovy acting as a service mesh in a side car can be confirmed to send spans to the collectors. 
    * all the application needs to set is the ot-span-context is set (just an id)
