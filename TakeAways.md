# General Thoughts 


# Tooling 
* No Windows machines anywhere - even the Microsoft employees went out of their way to show off their Macs.
    * No Linux Subsystem. Boo.
* Visual Studio Code was everywhere! 
* Programming language of choice in Demos - Go followed by Python
* Everyone is still using GitHub to host their code repositories.
    * No one mentioned Azure DevOps as a CI platform, not even Vendors 
* No one seems to like creating k8s yaml configuration files.  
    * Everyone is creating their own tool though very intereted in Helm
